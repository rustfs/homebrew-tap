      Thank you for installing rustfs-cli alias rc!

      === Quick Start ===
      # View all available commands and help information:
      rc --help

      # Check the version:
      rc --version

      === Developer Guide ===
      If you want to build from source manually:

      1. Clone the repository:
         git clone https://github.com/#{GITHUB_REPO}.git
         cd cli

      2. Compile the project:
         cargo build --release

      4. The binary will be located at:
         ./target/release/cli

      === Additional Notes ===
      If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, ensure the following are installed:
      - Rust toolchain (install via Homebrew or from https://rustup.rs/)
    EOS
