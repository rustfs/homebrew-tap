      Thank you for installing rustfs!

      === Quick Start ===
      # View all available commands and help information:
      rustfs --help

      # Check the version:
      rustfs --version

      === Alternative Installation ===
      To build and install RustFS directly from crates.io, use Cargo:
        cargo install rustfs

      Cargo resolves Rust dependencies automatically. Use a compatible Rust toolchain.
